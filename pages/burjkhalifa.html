				This is me after my climbing race up the Burj Khalifa. I was able to do this thanks to my diet of bread and Jake's Really Good Olive Oil.
				I also poured olive oil down the tower to stop my competitors. I climbed up in half an hour ish, and I parachuted off afterwards.
				The funny thing is, the race was set up by my company, and the prize was a lifetime's supply of olive oil. I don't mind though, I like olive oil.
				You can drink it, you can fry with it, you can baste with it, you can dip bread in it, and you can pour it over hummus. It's the peak of versatility.

				Burj Khalifa (Arabic: برج خليفة, "Khalifa Tower") is a megatall skyscraper in Dubai, 
				United Arab Emirates named after Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and is the tallest building ever built, at 828 metres (2,717 ft).
				Before the building opened, it was called Burj Dubai. The building is 162 stories high. Construction of the tower was started on 6 January 2004,
				 and the building was officially opened on 4 January 2010, almost 6 years later.
				 It is the tallest structure made by humans in the world. The building is more than 300 metres (980 ft) taller than Taipei 101.
				  Taipei 101 was the tallest building until 2010 before Burj Khalifa was built.
				Adrian Smith designed the tower. He worked with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) until 2006.
				It was built by Samsung Engineering & Construction, Besix, and Arabtec. The tower cost US $1.5 billion to build.
				 The building is part of a 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) building project on Sheikh Zayed Road, Downtown Burj Khalifa. 
				 It is near Dubai's main business district.
