				From Kabul there are two very rough dirt roads to Bamiyan, the southern route through Wardak Province and across Hajigak Pass being shorter, more dangerous and more frequently used by public transport.
				It's advisable to try to blend in on this route for the first hour or so out of Kabul - using a scarf as the Afghans do to cover your head, nose and mouth keeps the dust out and helps to lower your profile.
				Toyota 4WD shared minivans seating 5-10 passengers leave Kabul starting at 04:00 daily and cost 400 Afghanis (you may have to and should bargain hard for this price), and take around 9 hours.
				Bamyan Valley The northern route starts from the road heading north from Kabul, near Charikar. For an hour and a half on good tarmac road.
				From Charikar it goes through Parwan Province, passing Ghorband towards Shibar Pass (some 2 900 m) on a gravel road refurbished in 2007. Total travelling time some 8 hours.
				Several check-posts require a local guide.From Herat it is a very long and hard multi-part journey via the minaret of Jam, taking at least 3 days in Toyota minivans.
				Enquire in Herat about the current safety situation.From Mazar-e Sharif the old route to Kabul runs through Bamiyan.
				The gravel road within Bamyan Province (from Du-Ab) has some bottlenecks. When you're ready to make an exit, minivans depart from Mama Najaf's restaurant daily for Kabul (9 hours, 400 Afs).
				Inquire here for any other destinations you may have in mind, if there's not something heading there you can arrange a private hire minivan.

				The Buddhas of Bamiyan (Persian: بت‌های باميان – but hay-e bamiyan) were two 6th century monumental statues of standing Buddhas carved into the side of a cliff. 
				They are in the Bamyan valley in the Hazarajat region of central Afghanistan.
				They were dynamited and destroyed in March 2001 by the Taliban. Japan and Switzerland, among others, have said they would help rebuild the statues.
