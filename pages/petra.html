				This is an image of when I went to Petra in the year 200 BCE. It was pretty cool. The red dust started turning me red as well :(
				<br>
				It's in the middle of nowhere, but luckily, thanks to my private jet(s) I could land on top of it.
				Did you know that olives come from Asia Minor, which is kind of near Jordan? 
				That's kind of freaky because I like olive oil, and I also make olive oil. I am the biggest exporter of olive oil.
				It is very good. No, I will not give away my secret blueprints for my magic science force field. Let's just say,
				it has something to do with superheating olive oil (any that isn't high enough quality) under high pressures, 
				and then shooting it out of thousands of small tubes in a 360 degree circle around my island. 
				The arc of the boiling olive oil streams flies all the way over my island, and forms an almost inpenetrable wall of oil. 
				Anything that touches this is either immediately melted, or ripped to shrapnel and shot up in the air by the force of the olive oil.
				I kind of just gave away the entire design. Moving on, Jordan is a beautiful country, with a lot of sand. Sand is not good to get in my olive oil. 
				My olive oil is under 2% sand at least. Only slightly crunchy. Imagine it as texture, or a little garnish.

				Petra is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan.

				It is in a basin among the mountains that run from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.

				History
				Petra is believed to have been settled as early as 9,000 BC. It became the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who used Petra because it was near the spice trade routes.

				The Nabataean Kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC. In 106 AD they lost their independence. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes developed. Also, an earthquake in 363 AD destroyed many structures.

				The Byzantine Era led to the construction of several Christian churches, but the city continued to decline. By the early Islamic era only a handful of nomads lived in Petra. It stayed unknown to the world until it was rediscovered in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.

				UNESCO Status
				Petra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described it as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage".

				Petra is Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked to half a million in the first quarter of 2019.
