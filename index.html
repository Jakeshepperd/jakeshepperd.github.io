				This is a website I'm using to share my very real travel photos of places I really went to.
				I promise that I did actually go to these places, because I would never feel comfortable decieving all of you by lying. 
				It would be especially bad if I edited myself into these photos, and then pretended I was there with clever positioning, 
				highlights, colour correction, and other various photo editing techniques. I hope your trust in me and these photographs
				 is strong enough to believe in my incredibly real travel website, because otherwise the entire core concept of this website is fundamentally flawed, 
				 and is esentially a useless organisation of bytes, nothing more than a few files clogging up the storage of the computer this
				  is installed to. <br><br>I apologise if this website possibly decieved or inconvenienced you. If that's the case, you can simply
				   leave by pressing the little cross somewhere near the top of your browser. On chrome, this is called the "close tab" button. 
				   I don't know where this button is located or what the aforementioned button is called in different browsers. 
				   Hopefully you are proficient enough in your technology that you can, utilising your own intuition, skill, and technical knowledge,
				    find this button and close the tab if you so wish. <br><br> This advice also goes for anybody who doesn't 
				   believe that I went all of the way to Afghanistan or to the top of the Burj Khalifa. I see you. 
				I did go there, I set up my camera (an IMAX, by the way) on a little rusty tripod I borrowed from a farmer in Turkey,
			and took one singular photograph for every location. Many more photographs did not make the cut, and so the trip was all but wasted,
			 however that doesn't matter because I'm actually a billionaire. <br><br> I sell really good olive oil, and live on a private island with a magic science force field dome.
			 It can survive attacks from three unspecified major world powers. This is important, because of the four hundred █████ ███████ ███ ████ the █████ ███.
			 Anyway, that's not important for this website. Each photo is perfectly composed, quite nice, and very good. Just like the very good olive oil my company sells. Please buy it.
			 <br><br>Olive oil is a vegetable oil. It is made by getting the juice of the fruits of the olive tree. These are called olives. 
			 The oil is used in cooking, as well as cosmetics, traditional medicine, and as a fuel for oil lamps. Refined olive oil uses heat and chemicals to get the fat out of the olives.
			 Olive oil quality is defined by some parameters that are measured by chemical analysis. One of the most important is acidity. 
			 The highest quality olive oil (Extra-Virgin) must feature an acidity lower than 0.8%. My olive oil is around ~0.1%. Greece has more than a third of the world's olive trees,
			  and would be the top producer of olive oil in the world, if not for my company. It sells a lot of very good olive oil.
